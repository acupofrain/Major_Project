# Major Project Proposal for Computer Science 30
I plan to make a game for major project, but I'm not sure about its actual type. I'll describe it as best as I can:
I got the idea from a Janpanese game called Danganlopa. There are three major parts in this game: normal life, searching, and class trial.
Normal life is like a vsual novel which tells the story between the characters.
Searching starts after somebody saw a victum of murder, so player needs to search for the evidence of murder.
Class trial is my favorite part. All the characters(including the murder) will find the murder together by discussing. 
I want to make a game like the class trial in Danganlopa.
