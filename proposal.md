# Major Project Proposal for Computer Science 30
I plan to create a game in processing as my major project. I got the idea of this game from a Japanese game called Danganronpa.
My game will be a simplified version of the "class trial" part of Danganronpa. There will be multiple characters in the game,
and the player can only control one of them (the main character). These characters will discuss one thing together. Their speech
will fly through the screen while they are talking, like floating and moving subtitles. The player needs to find out lies in
other characters' speech, and shoot their speech. It's basically a shooting game combined with "find out the liar in these people".
