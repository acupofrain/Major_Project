# Major Project Proposal for Computer Science 30

## Description:
I plan to create a game in processing as my major project. I got the idea of this game from a Japanese game called Danganronpa.
My game will be a simplified version of the "class trial" part of Danganronpa. There will be multiple characters in the game,
and the player can only control one of them (the main character). These characters will discuss one thing together. Their speech
will fly through the screen while they are talking, like floating and moving subtitles. The player needs to find out lies in
other characters' speech, and shoot their speech. It's basically a shooting game combined with "find out the liar in these people".

## Timeline:
- [ ] May: work on the basic version of the game; be able to actually play it; shooting part is done
- [ ] First week in June: work on the graphic of the game
- [ ] Second week in June: work on the scoring system of the game

## Must have's:
- [ ] shooting part
- [ ] floating and moving speeches of the characters
- [ ] show the character who is currently talking
- [ ] life/health system
- [ ] time limit

## Nice to have's:
- [ ] be able to slow down the speed of speeches with the player's control (easier to shoot)
- [ ] scoring system
- [ ] better graphics
- [ ] sound effects
- [ ] character voices (this one is the least thing likely to be done...)
